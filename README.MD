### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

General project documentation is to be compiled as a single markdown file named README.md. This file should contain,

A link (URL) to your published portfolio website
A link to your GitHub repo
A link to your presentation video
Description of your portfolio website, including,
Purpose
Functionality / features
Sitemap
Screenshots
Target audience
Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)

### Footer

Footer has social media links, author and copyright information.
I found it interesting that you had to use &copy; instead of pasting a symbol directly into the code however the reasoning behind it makes sense.

```html
<footer>
  <div class="socials">
    <a href="https://github.com/fvduma" target="_blank"
      ><img src="assets/github.svg" alt="github" class="github"
    /></a>
    <a
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fadumah/?originalSubdomain=au"
      target="_blank"
      ><img src="assets/linkedin.svg" alt="linkedin" class="linkedin"
    /></a>
    <a href="https://www.twitter.com" target="_blank"
      ><img src="assets/twitter.svg" alt="twitter" class="twitter"
    /></a>
    <!-- Don't have twitter but felt empty with only 2 links :D -->
